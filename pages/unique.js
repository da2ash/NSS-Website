					        	<p>DJ NSS started with its Project Parichay at St. Mary's, Kandivali with personality development sessions for Grade 8 and 9. The volunteers distributed themselves into two groups for each of the classes. The lecture began with a short ice breaking session to help students connect better with the volunteers. Also, a brief explanation was given to them about "WHY" are these sessions important. For better and easy understanding, the topics related to the importance of never giving up, confidence, hard work and postures were put forth to them in the form of motivating stories. The sessions ended with a small homework given to them. The appreciation from the Principal of the institution was like the cherry on top of the cake.

					        	<p>	After an active session on Postures and their importance in Personality Development the previous week, the students of grades 8 and 9 of St. Mary’s, Kandivali were excited to learn more. The second session started with a revision. As a way to test the student's learnings, each was asked to introduce themselves in a line; it was observed that their posture and confidence had improved remarkably over the week. The new lesson included a crucial parameter in the overall development of personality, which is even used by MNCs in their day-to-day functioning: SWOT Analysis. SWOT stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat. The idea is to list down each of these in a tabular format, to devise methods of self-improvement! The mesmerised students were asked to try it out for themselves. Each one made a list of the four parameters. It was noted that each student was afraid of failing. The volunteers made them understand the necessity of threats in life; how failures trigger a bigger success! The students seemed to be enjoying the session and promised to work on their weaknesses as an assignment!

					        	<p>After a beautiful class on Personal Development, as promised by the students of grades 8 and 9 of St. Mary’s Kandivali, tried figuring out their weaknesses and took efforts in overcoming them. In this session the class focused on one of the most essential topics in developing one’s personality, thereby maximising their knowledge with a touch of responsibility, and enhance new skills which one can implement in future: TEAMWORK. The only motto of Teamwork is to divide the task and multiply the success. The students were told about the importance of Team Work by demonstrating real-life examples and how building a team can mould an individual’s life. Students of grade 8 and 9 were divided into a group of three and two respectively. They were provided with newspapers and a pair of scissors to make a superhero which inspires their lives. The response of the students was pretty satisfying which proved our message had reached them. Also, it was surprising to see students come up with such unique ideas.

					        	<h4><strong>Parichay Week 4</strong></h4>
					        	<p>To help students become great leaders in future, DJNSS took the 4th and the last session of Parichay on speech and elocution. It took a powerful speech for Mark Antony to gain justice for his friend Julius Caesar, for Gandhiji to unite India against the British. The St. Mary's students were explained this and taught on how to give speeches. Not only words are important in speeches but also gestures, speaking pace and voice modulation. Great speeches go hand in hand with great convincing skills. It holds the power to turn a crowd into a mob or a mob into a peaceful gathering. Keeping this in mind, a practice debate session was also held with the students that day. The mock debate was a practice for their upcoming debate competition. They enthusiastically participated and implemented their freshly taught skills. Delivering a good speech is a power to muster rather than having.
